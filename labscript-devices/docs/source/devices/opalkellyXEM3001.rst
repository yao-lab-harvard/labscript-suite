Cicero Opal-Kelly XEM3001
=========================

A pseudoclocking labscript device based on the OpalKelly XEM3001 integration module, which uses a Xilinx Spartan-3 FPGA.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Firmware (.bit) files for the FPGA are available `here <https://github.com/labscript-suite/opalkellyxem3001>`_ and should be placed in the labscript_devices folder along with the `CiceroOpalKellyXEM3001.py` file.
The Opal Kelly SDK, which provides the python bindings, is also required.
The python bindings will need to either be added to the PATH or manually copied to the site-packages of the virtual environment that BLACS is running in.
